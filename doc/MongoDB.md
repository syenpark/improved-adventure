__Raw Data -> Gathering -> Extracting -> Cleaning -> Storing -> Analysis__  

Data scientists spend 70% of their time on data wrangling. Why is it challenging?

#### Data Format
Data comes from lots of formats including JSON, XML, CSV, Excel, HTML, and etc.

1. Tabular Formats: Spreadsheet like Excel, Google Spreadsheets consists of coloumns (features or fields) and rows (item or object).  
2. CSV Format: Fields are seperated by , and each line of text is a single row. c.f. TSV.
